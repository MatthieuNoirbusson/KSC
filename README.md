### How to use standalone

    # Make Zabbix's LLD JSON for Licenses on Kaspersky Security Center Server
    powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy "RemoteSigned" -File "ksc.ps1" -Action "Discovery" -ObjectType "License"

    # Get number of Hosts which have Critical State 
    ... "ksc.ps1" -Action "Count" -ObjectType "Host" -Key "Status.Critical" -consoleCP CP866

    # Get expiration date of license with "1C1C-000423-1323DEA0" serial number
    ... "ksc.ps1" -Action "Get" -ObjectType "License" -Key "KLLIC_LIMIT_DATE" -Id "1C1C-000423-1323DEA0"



### How to use with Zabbix
1. Just include [zbx_ksc.conf](https://github.com/zbx-sadman/ksc/tree/master/Zabbix_Templates/zbx_ksc.conf) to Zabbix Agent config;
2. Put _ksc.ps1_ to _C:\zabbix\scripts\_ dir;
3. Set Zabbix Agent's / Server's _Timeout_ to more that 3 sec (may be 10 or 30);
4. Import [template](https://github.com/zbx-sadman/HASP/tree/master/Zabbix_Templates) to Zabbix Server;
5. Watch to Zabbix's Latest Data.

**Note**
Do not try import Zabbix v2.4 template to Zabbix _pre_ v2.4. You need to edit .xml file and make some changes at discovery_rule - filter tags area and change _#_ to _<>_ in trigger expressions. I will try to make template to old Zabbix.

**Note**
You may need to use domain user credientals to access KSC. Refer to _Username_ / _Userpass_ / _UserDomain_ options.

**Note**
All available options are described in head of the script file.

### Hints
- To see keys, run script without **-Key** option: 
  _... "ksc.ps1" -Action "Get" -Object "**ObjectType**"_  
- For debug in standalone mode use _-defaultConsoleWidth_ option to leave console default width while run script and
   _-Verbose_ to get additional processing information;
- If you get Zabbix's "Should be JSON" - try to increase the number value in CONSOLE_WIDTH constant variable inside _ksc.ps1_. 
  Powershell use console width to format output JSON-lines and can break its. 

**Beware** frequent requests to PowerShell script eat CPU and increase Load. To avoid it - don't use small update intervals with Zabbix's Data Items and disable unused.
